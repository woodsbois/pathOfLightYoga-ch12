        <h1>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h1>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side and palms up. Close your eyes and breathe<br>
        slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push <br>
        yourself into a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
